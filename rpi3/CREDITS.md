Almost all of the information about how to control the Raspberry PI 3
in "bare metal" mode came from the internet.  The primary sources are listed
below, but there are probably others that I have forgotten and for that
I apologize.  

These primary sources are absolutely critical if you want to know how the actual
hardware of the RPI works. In most cases I simply translate the wonderful
examples they provided from C to Go.  The authors did all the hard work.
